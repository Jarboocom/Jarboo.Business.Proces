When to estimate
----------------
Before we can estimate a task, it has to be very clear. That means we have to be able to say yes to the following:

 - Are there mockups of all views?
 - Is all the customers hidden assumptions clear?
 - Are third party integrations clear?

In general, we have to be able to fill out the template for project managers  in *C_25.4.3.1 - Template*.

How to estimate
---------------

It is essential to remember a development estimate isn't just coding. There are also project management, testing, code reviews, meetings with customers and so forth. An estimate has to have everything regarding it.
