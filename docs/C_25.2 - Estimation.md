Estimation
======

As described in our [task lifecycle](C_25.1.1 - Task lifecycle.md), we always work on estimates.

In the "ready for estimate" phase, a project manager will estimate the task (often together with an architect).

When the customer has accepted the estimate, the estimate is added Jira and the task starts.

How does the estimate work?
-----

An estimate is a best guess. An estimate accounts for time for project managers, architects, code reviewers, developers and testers. 

Therefore, an estimate is never just "how long time it takes to code".

The estimate might also seem quite high, but you have to remember there are so much more than just development.

What if an estimate is too low?
-----

If we can see an estimate is too low, and we can often see that quite early, we simply **stop the task**.

We then figure out what went wrong, how to fix it and what the new estimate should be.

Here the customer can accept or deny the estimate. If denied, we stop the task.
