Communication
======

In Jarboo we use Slack for communication.

Every project has a channel, which consists of the team and the customer. This channel than has a range of integrations towards for instance Github, Jira and potentially other platforms.

How to use Slack
----

As a general rule:
Avoid direct messages.

Yes, I know it's convenient to write a specific person (like @LarsHoldgaard), but it's important you don't because of the following reasons:

- It leads to knowledge getting lost
- Slower response rates, as other people might be able to help
- Less chatting about project
- The person you are writing to, are often **very** busy

Therefore, use the customer channel, and if you REALLY need a person, please tag them using the @ .

When not to use customer channel
-----

We have to remember the customer is inside the channel, so there are a couple of reasons not to use channels and use private messaging:

- When you see a big problem
- When the customer shouldn't see it
- When it's about personal things (like you're sick, you're unhappy, your dog has died, [...])


But for most project and task related questions? Always use the channel.
