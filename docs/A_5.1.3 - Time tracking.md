Time tracking
======

While we hope you also find our work fun and full of learning experiences, we also do this to make money.

It's therefore important you get back, as well as we get paid from our customers.

How we do time tracking
------

We always [work on estimates](C_25.2 - Estimation.md). That means whenever you register an hour, the customer pays for an hour.

You track all time spent in Jira on each time as described below.

How you get paid
------ 

You're most likely hired either through UpWork (or a similar platform) or through bank transfers.

UpWork: Getting paid through UpWork
-----

When you start working, you start the timer in UpWork. Then you start tracking time on the individual tasks inside Jira, and when you're done you stop the timer in UpWork.

**It's VERY important you match up numbers in both UpWork and Jira**. The hours spent in both systems has to match. If they do; you get paid and I get paid from the customer :-)

Bank transfers
-----

We simply export all hours used inside Jira, and pay the hours used there.
