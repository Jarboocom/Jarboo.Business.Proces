Setup a new resource in Jira
===============================

1. Go to user management:

![User management](/images/jira_user_management.png)

2. Add the users needed on the project:

![Users on project](/images/jira_create_user.png)

3. Add roles for each project:

For each project the resource is going to work on, add the "-developer" role. Ie. the "jarboo-developer" group if he is going to work on Jarboo.
